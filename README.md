# Simple-text-1

This LaTeX code defines a basic document using the `article` document class. It begins with `\begin{document}` and ends with `\end{document}`, encapsulating the content. Inside, there's a simple text: "First document. This is a simple example, with no extra parameters or packages included." This code serves as a starting point for creating more complex documents, offering a clean slate for adding content, formatting, and additional packages as needed.

```
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
This is a simple example, with no extra parameters or packages included.
\end{document}
